    "To backup your notebook in Binder, go to `File > Download as > Notebook (.ipynb)`.\n",

    "If you happen to loose your connection, then you will be able to upload your backup in Binder: \n",
    "- click again on the Binder button on the [github repo](https://github.com/automaticCollationLausanne2020/Materials)\n",
    "- when the file manager opens, navigate to the folder of session 8\n",
    "- click on `upload` as shown in the image below, and select your backup .ipynb notebook\n",
