He got up trembling, he had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to go out to fetch it and hide in the cellar behind the beer-barrel and not come out again till all the dwarves had gone away.
Suddenly he found them all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark. 'Where are you going?' said Gandlaf in a tone that seemed to show he guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.
'What about a little light?' said Bilbo.
'We like the dark' said all the dwarves: 'Dark for dark business. There are many hours before dawn'.
'Oh' said Bilbo and sat down again in a hurry - he sat on the fender and knocked the poker and the shovel over with a crash.
'Hush' said Bladorthin. 'Let Gandalf speak.' And this is how he began.
'Bladorthin, Dwarves, and Mr Baggins. We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow-conspirator, this most excellent and audacious Hobbit - praised be his wine, and ale -' (but this praise was lost on Bilbo Baggins who was wagging his mouth in protest against being a fellow-conspirator and audacious, but no noise would come he was so upsettled). 'We are met to discuss our plans. We shall start soon before the break of day on our long journey - a journey from which some of us (or all of us with the probable exception of Bladorthin) may never return. The object of our journey is well-known to all of you. To Mr Baggins, and to one or two of the younger dwarves (Kili and Fili at any rate - if I am not mistaken) the exact situation at the moment may require explanation.'
This was Gandalf's style. In the end he would probably have said all he wanted to, and left a little time over for some of the others to have a word. But on this occasion he was rudely interrupted.
Poor Bilbo could not bear it any longer. At 'may never return' he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon after it burst out like a whistling engine coming out of a tunnel.
